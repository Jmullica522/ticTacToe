## Features
At this time the site is relatively simple with only one dominate feature. This feature being **Tic Tac Toe** of course! The X player gets a fancy red background while the O player gets a calmer blue background on their squares. The site also features a nice little reset button in the corner that will refresh the page for you so you can play again!

### Planned projects

1. Adjust header bar with more links

#### Known bugs/missing Features

1. A win counter that carries over refresh

2. Logic to check for a tie

3. Clicking on a selected square results in a turn change despite invalid move
