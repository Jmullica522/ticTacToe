###Features
At this time the site is relatively simple with only one dominate feature. This feature being **Tic Tac Toe** of course! The X player gets a fancy red background while the O player gets a calmer blue background on their squares. The site also features a nice little reset button in the corner that will refresh the page for you so you can play again!

####Known bugs/missing Features

1. Still need to fix the logic to check for a win going diagonally across the board

2. A win counter that carries over refresh

3. Logic to check for a time
